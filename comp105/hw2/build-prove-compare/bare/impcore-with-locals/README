Operational Semantics Assignment, COMP-105
==========================================
Ben Tanen & Amit Patel

Our solution involved making a new local variable environment by combining the 
local and formal namelists and valuelists. This was all done in eval.c within 
the eval function (under the USERDEF switch case). This was done by making two
empty lists and copy the values first from the local lists and then appending
the values and names from the formal variable lists. They were then combined.

Additionally, we made small changes to the basis definitions in impcore.c to
fit with the new local variable declaration standard.

In total, this assignment took us 3.5hrs.
