This assignment took me approximately 10 hours, most of which was spent
on part B for the proofs. I spent approximately 4 hours on part A and
6 hours for part B.

I believe that I did fairly well for the proofs of part A. I believe I
explained my logic and reasoning clearly and did not make inaccurate
assumptions and steps in my proofs. My only potential downside to any of
the proofs is that I could see missing a corner case that fully satisfies
the needs of the proof.
