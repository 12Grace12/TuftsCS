"Analyze" Function
purpose: this function is the "brains" of the program. It feeds
         to other functions that analyze the plate and determine/output
         the numbers (and their location) on the plate
arguments: takes in the plate[] array (char) and the digs[] array (char)
returns: nothing
effects: feeds to other functions that output the location of the
         plate's numbers
note: this is the overall parent function. Feeds to all below functions
      (either directly or indirectly)


"Print Plate" Function
purpose: this function prints out each character in the plate[] array
         in turn, which ultimatly prints the plate as a whole
arguments: takes in the plate[] array (char)
returns: nothing
effects: prints out the given plate
note: this is primarily used for testing purposes


"Analyze Cell" Function
purpose: once a "#" is found and it is determined that the cell is
         not in the no_test[] array, this function uses the number-
         analysis and point-analysis functions to decide a given
         character is
arguments: takes in the plate[] array (char), the location of the "#"
           (col, row (int)), the results[] array (int), the no_test[] 
           array (int), and the digs[] array (char)
returns: nothing
effects: nothing (see note)
note: this function itself does nothing, but it does lead to other
      functions (store_results, make_no_test) that modify the
      results[] and no_test[] array


"Print Result" Function
purpose: this function takes in the results[] array and prints out
         the number and its location in the designated format
arguments: takes in the results[] array (int)
returns: nothing (prints results)
effects: this prints out the results from the results[] array
note: if the number is unknown it returns a -1


"Store Result" Function
purpose: this function takes in the determined identity of a number and
         its location and adds these to the results array that is used
         at the end
arguments: takes in the known identity of the number (int), the location
           (int for col/row), and the results[] array
returns: nothing (modifies result[])
effects: this adds the number and the location of the number to the 
         result[] array
notes: none


"Make No Test" Function
purpose: this function takes in the below arguments and adds points to
         the no_test array that is used to determine if the analyze
         function should analyze a found point
arguments: the known identify of the found number (int), the location
           of the top left corner (int col/row), the no_test[] array (int)
           and the digs[] array
returns: nothing (modifies no_test[])
effects: this adds certain point/locations to the no_test[] array
         after it is determined these are part of the known number
notes: none


"Should Test" Test
purpose: this function is given a particular point and then
         searches through the no_test[] array to determine
         if it should be tested
arguments: integers for row and col (describing the point)
           and the no_test[] array
returns: true or false
effects: no modifications
notes: none


Number Analysis Functions
purpose: the following 10 functions use the point-analysis functions
         below to determine the identity of the unknown number
         on the plate
arguments: the plate array, integers for the col,row value
returns: true or false
effects: no modifications
note: this describes the functions is_1(), is_2(), ... is_9(), is_0()


Point Analysis Functions
purpose: these functions deteremine (bool) if there is '#' located
         at different points (top-middle, center, etc) based on
         a given (row,col) point
arguments: the plate array, integers for the col,row value
returns: true or false
effects: no modifications
note: this describes the next seven functions
note: this descirbes the functions pt_mbl(), pt_ctr(), etc.
