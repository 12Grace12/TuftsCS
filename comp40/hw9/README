# Comp 40 Assignment 9 : ASM Coding
## Ben Tanen (btanen01) & McKenzie Welter (mwelte01)

Collaboration and Assistance    : thanks TA's :) especially Peter Lee, who is
                                  so awesome and chill and elderly. Dan Kane,
                                  you're beard let us down this time.

Everything is correctly implemented according to specifications.

Departures from recommended calling conventions :
        - r0 was used as the constant zero register, as recommended
        - r1 was, on occasion, used to hold the return address, as recommended.
          However, it was also used as a general purpose register and briefly
          as a temporary register.
        - r2 was used as the stack pointer (the value stack), as recommended
        - r3 and r4 were used as volatile general purpose registers, as
          opposed to the recommended nonvolatile registers.
        - r5 was used as a volatile general purpose register as recommended.
        - r6 and r7 were used as temporary registers as recommended

Print Module Implentation :
        The print module was implemented by popping numbers off the value stack,
        pushing those values onto another stack for safekeeping, and extracting
        and printing the individual digits using modulos of increasing powers of
        ten.
