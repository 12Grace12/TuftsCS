This file goes with part 8 of the first lab.  The idea is to give you
some practice thinking about the names of functions.  The problem is a
simple one, so we're going the software equivalent of shooting a fly
with an elephant gun, but because the problem is so simple, it makes
it easy to have a short practice session.

Here is the problem:

  - Suggest three different functions that might be useful in
    implementing `brightness`.

  - For each function, suggest three possible names.

  - For each function, say which name you think is most appropriate
    and *why*.



Function #1:

  Job: Get information from the header file of our .pnm file

  Candidate names: getInfo(), getHeaderInfo(), headInfo()

  Best name: getHeaderInfo()

  Why the given name is the best: it is clear that this function is getting
  information from the header. This is better than headInfo() because this
  isn't clear what it is doing with headInfo(). It is also better than
  getInfo() because it is not clear what info getInfo would get.


Function #2:

  Job: Calculate average of a set of numbers

  Candidate names: calcAverage(), average(), avg_fxn() 

  Best name: calcAverage()

  Why the given name is the best: Like function #1, calcAverage() is the most
  clear about what the function is actually doing and ultimately returning.
  While average() is not terrible, calcAverage() is slightly more clear. 
  avg_fxn() is just a poor name because it is redundant and unclear.


Function #3:

  Job: Get the brightness of a particular pixel

  Candidate names: getPxlBrightness(), brightness(), pixel() 

  Best name: getPxlBrightness()

  Why the given name is the best: Like the previous 2 function names, 
  getPxlBrightness() is the most clear about the fact that it is getting the
  brightness information from a particular pixel. brightness() is close but
  isn't clear about getting the information from a pixel and pixel() is bad
  because it does not specify what it is doing with a pixel.
