UNBLACKEDGES

Please put answers to questions here.

  * What fraction of time is spent in I/O as compared with removing
    black edges?

    60.07% of the time is spent on the pbmwrite() and pbmread() functions
    which are primarily IO functions.
    The actual IO functions (read_raw_bit, putc) take 17.2% of the time.
  
  * How long does time ./unblackedges take?
 
    Running ./unblackedges on the hyphen.png image takes 500ms.
 
  * After making changes requested in the lab handout (steps 1-4), what
    happened to the total time?
 
    The total time decreased by 10ms from 500ms to 490ms.
 
  * What happened to the fraction of time spent in Bit_put?

    Initially, Bit_put took 8.69% of the running time.
    With the improvements, it now takes 8.73% of the time. That is a 
    -0.04% improvement.
 
  * Since the implementation of Bit_put has not been improved, what has
    changed?
 
    There are fewer calls to remove_black_edges (because of the BFS approach)
    which takes up less running time. This will ultimately increase the
    fraction of time that is taken up by Bit_put because no improvement has
    been made there (thus the increase).
